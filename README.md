# Sr35_gene_editing
This is a project of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of the stem rust resistance gene Sr35
The Sr35_gDNA file contains the full length Sr35 gene sequence including the introns
The first step is to identify intron-exon boundaries(and/or reading frames) in order to a more certain exon target. 
Step 4 can be done on the program called ApE available at http://biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape/
